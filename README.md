# three.js typescript starter project
three.js typescript starter project template

install packages
`npm i`

run project
`npm run start`

editing code in src/ folder will trigger automatic re-builds,
the gulp pipeline will compile typescript code and then bundle it for browsers using esbuild. 
when tasks in the gulp pipeline have finished, a dev server is started that automatically reloads on changes

future todo's:
- turn project into an executable binary similiar to "npx create react app"
